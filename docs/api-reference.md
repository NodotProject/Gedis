| `flushdb()`                      | Deletes all keys from the database. Alias for `flushall`.  |
| `type(key)`                      | Returns the string representation of the type of the value stored at `key`. The different types that can be returned are: `string`, `list`, `set`, `zset`, `hash` and `stream`. |
| `renamenx(key, new_key)`         | Renames `key` to `new_key`, only if `new_key` does not exist. |
| `randomkey()`                    | Returns a random key from the currently selected database. |
| `dbsize()`                       | Returns the number of keys in the currently selected database. |
| **Strings**                      |                                                            |
| `set_value(key, value)`          | Sets the value of a key.                                   |
| `get_value(key)`                 | Gets the value of a key.                                   |
| `del(keys)`                      | Deletes one or more keys (accepts Array).                  |
| `exists(keys)`                   | Checks if keys exist (accepts Array).                      |
| `key_exists(key)`                | Checks if a single key exists.                             |

| `append(key, value)`             | If `key` already exists and is a string, this command appends the `value` at the end of the string. If `key` does not exist it is created and set as an empty string, so `APPEND` will be similar to `SET` in this special case. |
| `getset(key, value)`             | Atomically sets `key` to `value` and returns the old value stored at `key`. |
| `strlen(key)`                    | Returns the length of the string value stored at `key`. An error is returned when `key` holds a non-string value. |

| `hmget(key, fields)`             | Returns the values associated with the specified `fields` in the hash stored at `key`. |
| `hmset(key, values)`             | Sets the specified `fields` to their respective `values` in the hash stored at `key`. This command overwrites any existing fields in the hash. |
| `hincrby(key, field, amount)`    | Increments the integer value of a hash `field` by the given `amount`. |
| `hincrbyfloat(key, field, amount)`| Increments the float value of a hash `field` by the given `amount`. |

Directions (`from` and `to`, which can be `LEFT` or `RIGHT`) specify which side to pop from and which side to push to. Returns the moved element or `null` if the source is empty. Creates the destination list if it doesnâ€™t exist. This command replaces the deprecated `RPOPLPUSH` command. |
