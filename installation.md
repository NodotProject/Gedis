## Installation

1.  Copy the entire `addons/Gedis` folder into your Godot project's `addons` directory.
2.  In Godot, go to **Project -> Project Settings -> Plugins** and enable the "Gedis" plugin.
3.  The plugin will register an autoloaded singleton named `Gedis`, which is now available globally in your scripts.
